### Goals
* Relaxed, fun, community learning and texturing environment
* Support for your favorite mods and mod packs
* Support for requested mods. Open an issue if you have a request.
_We welcome support for any mod!_

### Guidelines
* Be careful to style your work to match the graphics in Soartex. We are happy to help newcomers!
* Feel free to use any texture in the repository or vanilla Soartex, but do not claim them as your own
* Mod names should be capitalized, separated by underscores and should not be abbreviated
* If there is a breaking texture change to the legacy versions of the mod, open an issue

### Tools
* A number of [texture templates, psd and xcf files, scripts and guides](https://github.com/Soartex-Modded/Templates) are available.
* There is a ["Resource Wrangler" python package](https://github.com/Soartex-Modded/Resource-Wrangler) for developing on patches and merging patches into a resource pack.

### How to submit your own textures

Don't want to go through git? 
Open an issue with your patch in a .zip file. 
It will take longer to review these contributions, because git makes this so easy for maintainers- 
but don't feel like a lack of knowledge in git is a barrier to you.
